Introduction</h3>

<p>As a little historical anecdote, ISC DHCP once packaged all the
	relevant RFCs and standards documents along with the software
	package.  Until one day when a voice was heard from one of the
	many fine institutions that build and distribute this software...
	they took issue with the IETF's copyright on the RFC's.  It
	seems the IETF's copyrights don't allow modification of RFC's
	(except for translation purposes).
</p>
<p>Our main purpose in providing the RFCs is to aid in
	documentation, but since RFCs are now available widely from many
	points of distribution on the Internet, there is no real need to
	provide the documents themselves.  So, this document has been
	created in their stead, to list the various IETF RFCs one might
	want to read, and to comment on how well (or poorly) we have
	managed to implement them.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Definition: Reference Implementation</h3>

<p>ISC DHCP, much like its other cousins in ISC software, is
	self-described as a 'Reference Implementation.'  There has been
	a great deal of confusion about this term.  Some people seem to
	think that this term applies to any software that once passed
	a piece of reference material on its way to market (but may do
	quite a lot of things that aren't described in any reference, or
	may choose to ignore the reference it saw entirely).  Other folks
	get confused by the word 'reference' and understand that to mean
	that there is some special status applied to the software - that
	the software itself is the reference by which all other software
	is measured.  Something along the lines of being "The DHCP
	Protocol's Reference Clock," it is supposed.
</p>
<p>The truth is actually quite a lot simpler.  Reference
	implementations are software packages which were written
	to behave precisely as appears in reference material.  They
	are written "to match reference."
</p>
<p>If the software has a behaviour that manifests itself
	externally (whether it be something as simple as the 'wire
	format' or something higher level, such as a complicated
	behaviour that arises from multiple message exchanges), that
	behaviour must be found in a reference document.
</p>
<p>Anything else is a bug, the only question is whether the
	bug is in reference or software (failing to implement the
	reference).
</p>
<p>This means:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To produce new externally-visible behaviour, one must first
	provide a reference.
</li>
<li>Before changing externally visible behaviour to work around
	simple incompatibilities in any other implementation, one must
	first provide a reference.
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is the lofty goal, at any rate.  It's well understood that,
	especially because the ISC DHCP Software package has not always been
	held to this standard (but not entirely due to it), there are many
	non-referenced behaviours within ISC DHCP.
</p>
<p>The primary goal of reference implementation is to prove the
	reference material.  If the reference material is good, then you
	should be able to sit down and write a program that implements the
	reference, to the word, and come to an implementation that
	is distinguishable from others in the details, but not in the
	facts of operating the protocol.  This means that there is no
	need for 'special knowledge' to work around arcane problems that
	were left undocumented.  No secret handshakes need to be learned
	to be imparted with the necessary "real documentation".
</p>
<p>Also, by accepting only reference as the guidebook for ISC
	DHCP's software implementation, anyone who can make an impact on
	the color texture or form of that reference has a (somewhat
	indirect) voice in ISC DHCP's software design.  As the IETF RFC's
	have been selected as the source of reference, that means everyone
	on the Internet with the will to participate has a say.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Low Layer References</h3>

<p>It may surprise you to realize that ISC DHCP implements 802.1
	'Ethernet' framing, Token Ring, and FDDI.  In order to bridge the
	gap there between these physical and DHCP layers, it must also
	implement IP and UDP framing.
</p>
<p>The reason for this stems from Unix systems' handling of BSD
	sockets (the general way one might engage in transmission of UDP
	packets) on unconfigured interfaces, or even the handling of
	broadcast addressing on configured interfaces.
</p>
<p>There are a few things that DHCP servers, relays, and clients all
	need to do in order to speak the DHCP protocol in strict compliance
	with <a class='info' href='#RFC2131'>RFC2131<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2131].
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Transmit a UDP packet from IP:0.0.0.0 Ethernet:Self, destined to
	IP:255.255.255.255 LinkLayer:Broadcast on an unconfigured (no IP
	address yet) interface.
</li>
<li>Receive a UDP packet from IP:remote-system LinkLayer:remote-system,
	destined to IP:255.255.255.255 LinkLayer:Broadcast, again on an
	unconfigured interface.
</li>
<li>Transmit a UDP packet from IP:Self, Ethernet:Seelf, destined to
	IP:remote-system LinkLayer:remote-system, without transmitting a
	single ARP.
</li>
<li>And of course the simple case, a regular IP unicast that is
	routed via the usual means (so it may be direct to a local system,
	with ARP providing the glue, or it may be to a remote system via
	one or more routers as normal).  In this case, the interfaces are
	always configured.
</li>
</ol>
<p>The above isn't as simple as it sounds on a regular BSD socket.
	Many unix implementations will transmit broadcasts not to
	255.255.255.255, but to x.y.z.255 (where x.y.z is the system's local
	subnet).  Such packets are not received by several known DHCP client
	implementations - and it's not their fault, <a class='info' href='#RFC2131'>RFC2131<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2131] very explicitly demands that these packets' IP
	destination addresses be set to 255.255.255.255.
</p>
<p>Receiving packets sent to 255.255.255.255 isn't a problem on most
	modern unixes...so long as the interface is configured.  When there
	is no IPv4 address on the interface, things become much more murky.
</p>
<p>So, for this convoluted and unfortunate state of affairs in the
	unix systems of the day ISC DHCP was manufactured, in order to do
	what it needs not only to implement the reference but to interoperate
	with other implementations, the software must create some form of
	raw socket to operate on.
</p>
<p>What it actually does is create, for each interface detected on
	the system, a Berkeley Packet Filter socket (or equivalent), and
	program it with a filter that brings in only DHCP packets.  A
	"fallback" UDP Berkeley socket is generally also created, a single
	one no matter how many interfaces.  Should the software need to
	transmit a contrived packet to the local network the packet is
	formed piece by piece and transmitted via the BPF socket.  Hence
	the need to implement many forms of Link Layer framing and above.
	The software gets away with not having to implement IP routing
	tables as well by simply utilizing the aforementioned 'fallback'
	UDP socket when unicasting between two configured systems is the
	need.
</p>
<p>Modern unixes have opened up some facilities that diminish how
	much of this sort of nefarious kludgery is necessary, but have not
	found the state of affairs absolutely absolved.  In particular,
	one might now unicast without ARP by inserting an entry into the
	ARP cache prior to transmitting.  Unconfigured interfaces remain
	the sticking point, however...on virtually no modern unixes is
	it possible to receive broadcast packets unless a local IPv4
	address has been configured, unless it is done with raw sockets.

<p>The DHCP Protocol is strange among protocols in that it is
	grafted over the top of another protocol - BOOTP (but we don't

	and procedures.  ISC DHCP is not known to diverge from this document
	in any way.  There are, however, a few points on which different
	implementations have arisen out of vagueries in the document.
	DHCP Clients exist which, at one time, present themselves as using
	a Client Identifier Option which is equal to the client's hardware
	address.  Later, the client transmits DHCP packets with no Client
	Identifier Option present - essentially identifying themselves using
	the hardware address.  Some DHCP Servers have been developed which
	identify this client as a single client.  ISC has interpreted
	RFC2131 to indicate that these clients must be treated as two
	separate entities (and hence two, separate addresses).  Client
	behaviour (Embedded Windows products) has developed that relies on
	the former implementation, and hence is incompatible with the
	latter.  Also, RFC2131 demands explicitly that some header fields
	be zeroed upon certain message types.  The ISC DHCP Server instead
	copies many of these fields from the packet received from the client
	or relay, which may not be zero.  It is not known if there is a good
	reason for this that has not been documented.

	formatting and processing options.  The document unfortunately
	waffles to a great extent about the NULL termination of DHCP Options,
	and some DHCP Clients (Windows 95) have been implemented that rely
	upon DHCP Options containing text strings to be NULL-terminated (or
	else they crash).  So, ISC DHCP detects if clients null-terminate the
	host-name option and, if so, null terminates any text options it
	transmits to the client.  It also removes NULL termination from any
	known text option it receives prior to any other processing.

DHCPv6 Protocol References</h3>

<p>For now there is only one document that specifies the DHCPv6
	protocol (there have been no updates yet), <a class='info' href='#RFC3315'>RFC3315<span> (</span><span class='info'>Droms, R., Bound, J., Volz, B., Lemon, T., Perkins, C., and M. Carney, &ldquo;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6),&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3315].
</p>
<p>Support for DHCPv6 was added first in version 4.0.0.  The server
	and client support only IA_NA.  While the server does support multiple
	IA_NAs within one packet from the client, our client only supports
	sending one.  There is no relay support.
</p>
<p>DHCPv6 introduces some new and uncomfortable ideas to the common
	software library.
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Options of zero length are normal in DHCPv6.  Currently, all
	  ISC DHCP software treats zero-length options as errors.
</li>
<li>Options sometimes may appear multiple times.  The common
	  library used to treat all appearance of multiple options as
	  specified in RFC2131 - to be concatenated.  DHCPv6 options
	  may sometimes appear multiple times (such as with IA_NA or
	  IAADDR), but often must not.
</li>
<li>The same option space appears in DHCPv6 packets multiple times.
	  If the packet was got via a relay, then the client's packet is
	  stored to an option within the relay's packet...if there were two
	  relays, this recurses.  At each of these steps, the root "DHCPv6
	  option space" is used.  Further, a client packet may contain an
	  IA_NA, which may contain an IAADDR - but really, in an abstract
	  sense, this is again re-encapsulation of the DHCPv6 option space
	  beneath options it also contains.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Precisely how to correctly support the above conundrums has not
	quite yet been settled, so support is incomplete.
